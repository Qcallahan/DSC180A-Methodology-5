**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The relastionship between text models and graph models, like how transformers built for the text domain can be converted to work in the graph domain.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

Investigating how knowledge graphs can be leveraged to better understand students reasoning in education

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I might benchmark fewer non transformeres models to make space for benchmarking a larger variety of transformer models.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am very interested in graph RAG, and ways it could be leveraged to help with our quarter 2 project
